## About Data 

how to work with a massive dataset of 135 million rows on a modest machine with limited resources, without a Power BI Premium subscription or any paid tools?
The solution was to turn to statistics, by selecting a sample representing approximately 2.5% of the total data, under specific conditions to ensure the data remained unbiased.
For example, if the original data distribution showed that Uber accounted for 75% of the data and Via for 25%, and the peak hours for orders were 6 PM at 7% and 7 PM at 5%, then the sample had to preserve these proportions as closely as possible.
This approach allowed me to reduce the dataset to a manageable size while maintaining the symmetry of the data and ensuring it stayed unbiased, so that no decisions based on the analysis would be distorted.

## The Objective Of Project 

The first objective focuses on the data analysis aspect, aiming to thoroughly and accurately understand the trip patterns. This includes identifying the busiest time periods in terms of trips, such as the months, days, or hours with the highest trip volumes, as well as recognizing the peak seasons of demand. The analysis also involves measuring key performance indicators, such as the average driver pickup time (Pickup Rate KPI), average trip duration, and average trip fare, along with other metrics that reflect trip behavior and service performance. These analyses are prepared and visualized using Power BI, enabling different teams to easily access these insights and make data-driven decisions accordingly.
